larity thresholds without editing code
2. Add new categories and keywords as their projects evolve
3. Customize skill generation patterns for their domain

This approach follows the "data over code" principle from the skill-creator research, making the skill more maintainable and adaptable.

## Configuration-Driven Design Pattern

**Configuration-Driven Design Pattern**

Rather than hardcoding clustering logic, we're externalizing it to YAML configuration files. This allows users to:
1. Tune similarity thresholds without editing code
2. Add new categories and keywords as their projects evolve
3. Customize skill generation patterns for their domain

This approach follows the "data over code" principle from the skill-creator research, making the skill more maintainable and adaptable.

## Template-Based Documentation vs. Executable Logic

**Template-Based Documentation vs. Executable Logic**

Notice that our templates use Jinja2-style syntax (`{{ variable }}`), but this is for documentation and reference only. In Claude Code skills, the actual logic is expressed as clear, step-by-step instructions in SKILL.md that I (Claude) interpret and execute. The templates serve as:
1. **Consistency guides** - showing expected output structure
2. **Reference patterns** - documenting best practices
3. **Quality standards** - setting expectations for generated content

This is different from traditional code generation where templates are programmatically rendered. Here, I read the templates as examples and generate similar output naturally.
