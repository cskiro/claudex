## Usage

Each category contains an `insights.md` file with chronologically ordered insights. Insights are automatically categorized based on content analysis.

### Manual Categorization

If you need to recategorize an insight:
1. Cut the insight from the current file
2. Paste it into the appropriate category file
3. The index will auto-update on the next extraction

### Searching

Use grep to search across all insights:
```bash
grep -r "your search term" docs/lessons-learned/
```

Or use ripgrep for faster searches:
```bash
rg "your search term" docs/lessons-learned/
```
