## Skill Design Pattern Selection

**Skill Design Pattern Selection**

The research revealed three key patterns for skill creation:
1. **Phase-based workflow** (used by skill-creator) - best for linear, multi-step processes
2. **Mode-based approach** (used by complex skills) - best for multiple distinct workflows
3. **Validation pattern** (used by auditor skills) - best for analysis and checking

For our insight-to-skill generator, we'll use the **phase-based workflow** pattern because the process is inherently sequential (discover → cluster → design → generate → install), and it aligns with how skill-creator already works, making the user experience consistent.
