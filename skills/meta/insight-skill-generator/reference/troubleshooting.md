# Troubleshooting Guide

## No insights found

**Symptoms**: Phase 1 reports 0 insights

**Solution**:
1. Verify `docs/lessons-learned/` exists in project
2. Check for alternative locations (ask user)
3. Verify insights were actually generated by extract-explanatory-insights hook
4. Check file naming pattern matches YYYY-MM-DD-*.md

**Prevention**: Set up extract-explanatory-insights hook if not already configured

## All insights cluster into one giant skill

**Symptoms**: Phase 2 creates one cluster with 10+ insights

**Solution**:
1. Increase clustering threshold (e.g., 0.6 → 0.7)
2. Enable sub-clustering (split by sub-topics or time periods)
3. Manually split cluster in Phase 2 user review
4. Create mode-based skill with different modes for different sub-topics

**Prevention**: Tune clustering-config.yaml thresholds for your domain

## Generated skill doesn't load

**Symptoms**: Skill not recognized by Claude Code after installation

**Solution**:
1. Check YAML frontmatter syntax (no tabs, proper dashes)
2. Verify name field is lowercase kebab-case
3. Check description doesn't contain special characters that break parsing
4. Restart Claude Code session
5. Check skill file permissions (should be readable)

**Prevention**: Always run validation in Phase 4 before installation

## Trigger phrases don't activate skill

**Symptoms**: Using trigger phrase doesn't invoke the skill

**Solution**:
1. Make trigger phrases more specific (avoid overly generic phrases)
2. Include domain keywords in trigger phrases
3. Add "PROACTIVELY when" to description for auto-triggering
4. Try exact phrase match vs. semantic match
5. Check for conflicts with built-in commands or other skills

**Prevention**: Test trigger phrases in Phase 5 before finalizing

## Generated content quality is low

**Symptoms**: SKILL.md is vague, missing details, or poorly organized

**Solution**:
1. Check insight quality (garbage in, garbage out)
2. Manually edit SKILL.md to improve clarity
3. Add more examples and context
4. Reorganize sections for better flow
5. Iterate to version 0.2.0 with improvements

**Prevention**: Filter low-quality insights in Phase 2, prioritize insights with clear action items
